# Redux

## A pattern that was inspired by Flux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

Pros:

1) Makes state predictable

2) Rigid. Redux is strict about how code should be organized.

3) Debugging

Cons:

1) Verbose (Jargons)

2) Code Complexity ( A lot of boilerplate code lol )

Ways to make redux less painful:

- Use Duck Redux pattern/convention
